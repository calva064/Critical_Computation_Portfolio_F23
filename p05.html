      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>
         For this sketch, I drew a bar code optical illusion. When looking at the canvas, the colored lines
         that make up the bar code appear to be purple or yellow. In fact, only red (255,0,0) 
         and blue (0,0,255) dots were used to draw the "purple" lines and only red (255,0,0) and green (0,255,0) dots were used to draw the 
         "yellow" lines. Because of how our brain processes stimuli, to the naked eye, these lines appear to be a combination of either red and blue (purple) or green and red (yellow);
         we cannot separate out the red from the blue or the red from the green unless we zoom in on the sketch.

      <h3>Design Process and Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        For this sketch, I began brainstorming ideas for different optical illusions that I might want to replicate.
        I started thinking about different toys I played with as a kid and considering if any of them incorporated 
        optical illusions.

        I looked at some previous students' projects for inspiration, and I noticed one student, Archit Saxena, used 
        mathematical concepts in their optical illusion. I was inspired by this student, because I studied mathematics
        in college, and so I decided to incorporate mathematics into my optical illusion.

        I took a geometry class during my junior year of college, and we discussed the applications of geometry in art,
        like drawing in perspective, for instance, so I thought this 
        would be an interesting place to start. I went back through my PowerPoint slides from college from this 
        particular class to see if anything inspired me. I came across something called the Poincaré disk, 
        which uses orthogonal circles to create curves inside of a circle. Poincaré disks create an interesting
        optical illusion, because objects inside a Poincaré disk seem to get
        smaller towards the boundary of the disk when, in reality, all objects inside the disk are the same size in
        the hyperbolic plane.

        I was inspired by artist M.C. Escher who creates art using Poincaré disks to create my own version. Here is an example of one of M.C. Escher's
          pieces inspired by the Poincaré disk:

               />
         
      <p>
        I decided to make an album cover for a musician I like, Arlo Parks, that incorporated a Poincaré disk. I was inspired by her song, Eugene, which mentions 
        different purple-colored objects and shades of purple, like amethyst, violet, and purple lips. I decided to 
        import an image of amethyst into p5.js for the background and then planned to use purple lips with a cigarette hanging
        out of them as my object that I would draw repeatedly inside the Poincaré disk, because one of her song lyrics is "purple lips with cigarettes."    

      
      </p>
      
   <img
             src="https://cdn.glitch.global/243f2e74-eb0b-41b9-8c26-f5d42f14d9ff/Screenshot%202023-10-10%20at%209.19.35%20PM.png?v=1696987207772"
        />
      
      <p>
        I intended to go about this by first drawing the Poincaré disk with the orthogonal curves inside of it
        and then drawing and importing images of purple lips and cigarettes into the sketch and aligning them along the
        curves. I spent a few hours refamiliarizing myself with the mathematics of how the Poincaré desk 
        works so that I could accurately draw the curves inside the disk. Unfortunately, I found drawing an orthogonal curve to
        an ellipse challenging. I tried using an if statement and the angleBetween() function to draw these orthogonal curves. 
        I tried using Pythagorean theorem and the equation of a circle, (x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2 to determine where two points on a curve orthogonal to the Poincaré disk should fall. 
        Sadly, I kept running into issues that slowed my progress. For instance, only after a while did I realize
        that I needed to adjust the equation of the circle because in p5.js, the positive y axis is down, not up. Despite everything I tried,
        I couldn't acheive the desired outcome: drawing orthogonal curves on a disk to create a Poincaré disk. After two days of trying to 
        get this to work, I realized that I  needed to switch my idea. While this Poincaré disk idea is something 
        I would love to revisit, in the interst of time, I needed to move on.
        Below is the embedded iframe with some of the code from
        my attempts at getting this to work. This includes code that is commented out:

      <p>
      I decided to switch gears and try something different. When I was initially brainstorming ideas for my optical illusion, 
      I was also interested in trying to replicate some kind of texture. I decided to take a photo of my cat's fur, pixel process it, 
      and try to make it look kind of funky. I used the get(x,y) function to get the RGB values of each pixel and then
      draw an ellipse at that particular x,y value filled with the same RGB values as the image at that particular x,y value. From there,
      I planned to experiment further with color, shape, and texture.  Unfortunately, I unexpectedly ran into issues again.
      My for loop that drew the ellipses would only seem to iterate on one particular Y value for all X values. The nested loop simply wasn't working.
      I wasn’t sure why, because when I created the drawCirc() function that took y as an argument, it worked (see embeded iframe below). My code also kept throwing an infinite loop error.
      Eventually, I decided to abandon this idea too, because my code simply wasn't working in the way I wanted it to, and I didn't think
        my sketch looked like an optical illusion. This is as far as I got with pixel processing the image of my cat's fur:

        For my final sketch, I decided to create an optical illusion with color and play around with Noise in order to achieve this.
        I'm happy with my use of Noise to create the bar code, because I didn't want the lines to be evenly spaced, but equally I didn't want them to be 
        erratically scattered. As mentioned above, my final bar code sketch works as an optical illusion due to the brain's ability to simplify stimuli. 
        
        <p>
        Originally, the 5th argument in each of the mapping functions was static:
      </p>
      <p>
    xpos = map(noise(xoff), 0, 1, 0, width);
    ypos = map(noise(yoff), 0, 1, 0, height);
      </p>
      
      <img
           src="https://cdn.glitch.global/243f2e74-eb0b-41b9-8c26-f5d42f14d9ff/Screenshot%202023-10-12%20at%2011.22.12%20AM.png?v=1697124183092"
           />
      <p>
        As a result, the lines in my sketch were scattered both horizontally and vertically. I wasn't happy with how this looked, so
        I decided to incorporate a nested for loop into my sketch and have the 5th argument change on each iteration of the loop. As a result,
        the lines only appeared vertically now.
      </p>

           />
        
        <p>
          I wanted the lines to extend all the way down the page, so I changed y to 2y and achieved my final result. I'm happy with
          the visual effect the ellipses give in making the sketch look like a realistic bar code.

        I wanted to add numbers to my bar code by adding text to the canvas and rotating it. Unfortunately, p5.js kept crashing when I tried to do this,
        so I wasn't able to incorporate the numbers into my sketch:
         </p>
      
      <img

      />

    <p>
      When thinking about how to deploy this optical illusion in the real world, I could envision it being featured
      on the back of a vinyl record sleeve, for instance. When scanned, a preview of the songs on the record could play.

        Overall,I have mixed feelings about my sketch this week. This week, I learned that sometimes, despite our best 
        efforts, we aren’t always able to execute on our intended vision, especially when we have  strict time 
        constraints and competing responsibilities. I learned that it’s important to know when to pivot 
        and  recognize that an idea is not working. I'm the kind of person who likes to keep chipping 
        away at something until I can get it to work, sometimes to a fault because it becomes all-consuming. Despite resistance, I had to be 
        force myself to be comfortable with pivoting, knowing that I could return to either of my two unfinished ideas in subsequent weeks.
