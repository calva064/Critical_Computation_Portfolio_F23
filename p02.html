      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>
        I chose to draw a woman dancing and singing to music, since I'm a dancer and music-lover. I wanted to 
        explore how to load sound into p5.js and animate the woman's movements while playing with color
        and facial expression.
      </p>

      <h3>Design Process and Reflection</h3>


      <p>
        
        I began this project by doing a 5-minute brain dump. I was inspired by a free-write exercise we did in MS1, 
        where we were required to write a 5-minute reflection without removing our pen from the page. 
         </p>
      <p>
        
        Here is a photo of my notes from my initial brain dump:
         </p>

        />

        
      <p>
        After looking through my ideas, I realized I was most drawn to the first one: drawing someone dancing and listening to music. 
        Once I settled on this idea, I created two hand-drawn sketches to visualize the intention for my design:
         </p>
      
         <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.global/243f2e74-eb0b-41b9-8c26-f5d42f14d9ff/Screenshot%202023-09-21%20at%206.03.53%20PM.png?v=1695333861837"
        />
      <img

        />
        
      <p>
        In translating my design to p5.js, I found that having the handrawn sketch on the 400x400 grid was useful. 
        This is a process I will implement when creating my next sketch.
        </p>
        <p>
        Overall, the process of creating this sketch was challenging, given how many different components I wanted to incorporate into it.
        I definitely set myself a challenge! 
        </p>
        <p>
        I began by drawing the woman. Given that I love to draw, I realized, while creating this sketch, that one of my strengths and weaknesses
        is that I like my work to look beautiful, which means I spend longer paying attention to small details
        than I perhaps should. For instance, in order to make the woman's hands look more realistic, I slightly darkened the color of the two inner
        fingers on her hand so that her fingers looked visually distinct. I also added nail polish to make her fingers pop. I love paying attention to little details like this, but often it can slow me down!
        </p>
        <p>
        Next, I knew I wanted to learn how to load sound into p5.js, since the woman in my sketch is listening to music. I tried loading one of my favorite songs into p5.js, 
        but I sadly realized that the file size limit for audio files in p5.js is 0.5mb, so I turned to YouTube's audio library, where I was able to 
        download a free audio clip that I could upload as an asset to p5.js. I referenced a Coding Train video and p5.js documentation in order to achieve this (references are provided below)
        From these references, I was inspired to use the mousePressed() function to stop and start the music. I also decided to change the color of the
        woman's headphones when the mouse was pressed. Despite having access to these resources, it took me a while to get the sound working.
        </p>
        <p>
        Afterwards, I turned my attention towards the background. From our in-class critique last week, my main takeaways were to be intentional with 
        every decision I make in my work and to pay attention to the background! I decided I wanted musical notes to be moving across the screen behind 
        the woman. I referenced the Coding Train bouncing ball video in order to help me with this. I had some issues with my for loop when creating the musical
        notes. I found that, unless I had noLoop() written in my setup function, then the musical notes would bounce erratically across the page, but, if I
        had noLoop() in my setup function, then it would interfere with all of the other functions I planned to use for my sketch like mousePressed. While
        this portion of the code isn't elegant, I spent so much time trying to get the for loop to work, that eventually I had to create the musical
        notes by brute force if I wanted to finish my sketch on time.
        </p>
        <p>
        Then, I began to explore mouseX and mouseY. I decided to use mouseY to change the shape of the woman's mouth, as if she were singing. While
        making her mouth into an ellipse would make the image more realistic, and I tried this, 
        I ultimately liked how the woman's lips looked when I also used arcs to create them:
        </p>
          <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.global/243f2e74-eb0b-41b9-8c26-f5d42f14d9ff/Screenshot%202023-09-21%20at%206.35.48%20PM.png?v=1695335779396"
          />
          <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.global/243f2e74-eb0b-41b9-8c26-f5d42f14d9ff/Screenshot%202023-09-21%20at%206.35.56%20PM.png?v=1695335776222"
          />
          
        
        <p>
        I then decided to use mouseX to make the woman's arms move left and right, as if she were dancing. Originally, I drew the woman's arms
          criss-crossed, as in the first image above, but I realized this may look slightly confusing, so I modified her arms to just move side to side.
          I also drew her hands so that they mimic the rock on symbol.
        </p>
      
      <p>
        At the last minute, I also decided to add text to my canvas to explain how to use my sketch.
      </p>
      
        <p>
          While creating this sketch, I attempted several things which I ultimately didn't implement because I was struggling after devoting a lot of time to them, 
          but here are some other ideas I had:
          <p>
           - Giving the woman freckles 
      </p>
          <p>
           - Using an array to load songs into and then allow users to pick and choose the songs using left and right arrow keys on the keyboad

      </p>
          
      </p>
        
        <p>
        My main observation about the form I chose, a woman singing and dancing, upon completing this assignment, is not to limit myself by the 
        bounds of reality. While I want people to be able to recognize what I'm trying to portay, if I want to make the woman's mouth physically
        larger or more curved than what is realistic, for instance, I should go for it!
        </p>
