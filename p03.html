      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>
                For my experimental clock, I chose to draw a person aging over the course of a day, 
        from sunrise to sunset, and view time as a function of age. I was keen to explore the notion of aging, since, on a daily basis, we can't see how we age.
        Specifically, I wanted to explore how there is beauty in aging, as we live in an age of botox and plastic surgery.

        My mom is an actress, and one of her physical features that I love most is her laughter lines. She has an expressive face, 
        and her wrinkles tell stories of her life. This clock encourages us to consider how the memories and stories from our day become etched into our face.

      <h3>Design Process and Reflection</h3>


      <p>
        
        I began the design process with a quick brainstorm. I considered the ways in which entities can change over time, 
        and I eventually narrowed my ideas down to three sketches: an aging clock, a color of leaves clock, and a menstrual
        cycle clock.

         </p>
      <p>
        
        Here are photos of my notes from this initial brainstorming process:         </p>
        <img

             />

           />

        
      <p>
      These were my intentions behind each of the three sketches:
      </p>
      
      <p>
        
        - The intention behind the aging clock, as mentioned, would be for the person in my sketch to age as the day passes(seconds tick by).
        
         </p>
      <p>
        - The intention behind the color of leaves clock would be for me to draw a tree that grows leaves whose colors change as time
        passes, a way to visualize the changing of the seasons. Eventually, the tree would shed its leaves.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        - The intention behind the menstrual cycle clock would be to track the hormonal and emotional changes a woman experiences
        over the course of her 28-day menstrual cycle.
      
      </p>

      
            <p>
        While I liked the idea behind the color of leaves clock, I'm always looking to incorporate human elements
        into my designs, so I rejected this idea. Though the menstrual clock, to some degree, incorporated
        a human element, I felt the sketch could become overly complicated, given all of the interacting biological
        processes that affect a woman's menstrual cycle. Plus, I felt most drawn to the idea of creating an aging clock,
        since, of the three, it evokes the most emotion and tenderness. I realized, through working on this sketch, that I 
        want people to describe my art as tender, comforting, or joyful, or be able to relate to the shared human experience
        communicated through my art.
        
        </p>
        
        <p>
        I began the sketch by drawing a man and considering physical markers of aging, like wrinkles and gray hair.
        Over time, I wanted the man's hair to change color and face to become wrinkled. Drawing the
        man took the most time, but once I'd drawn him, implementing if else statements to add wrinkles and change his hair
        was relatively straightforward.
          
        </p>

      <p>
         After finishing the man, it dawned on me that the background of my sketch was boring. I should have put consideration
          into what function the background would serve in my design during the brainstorming phase.
          I realized, though, that it wouldn't be totally clear to someone engaging with my sketch that the man was aging
          over the course of a day. This realization gave me inspiration to draw the sun rising and setting and moon rising 
          and setting in the background to mark the passage of time. Using time to change the sun/moon's x and y position 
          was challenging, since I wanted the sun/moon to travel in an arc-like shape. I ended up needing to use the modulo operator, 
          after banging my head against a wall trying to get division to work, in order to acheive the desired result. In addition,
          I ended up needing to make a separate if else condition for when t=45 seconds. Otherwise, the moon would bounce back to the x=0 position when
          t=45.
          
        </p>

        
        <p>
        I enjoyed making this sketch. As mentioned above, through this process, I discovered that I like making art that is tender, 
        comforting, or brings people joy. 
        </p>
