      <h2>Consentful Interface</h2>

        <a href="https://calva064.github.io/ConsentfulInterface/">Here</a> is a link to my sketch on Github. Refresh the Github page to hear the music.

      <h3>Design Process</h3>
      
      <p>
      Since the interface needed to be 'consentful,' I knew I wanted to incorporate an element that would allow users
      to decide whether or not they wanted to show or hide their camera, providing users with some sense of control and privacy. I also wanted to give users the ability to control the amount of horizontal space between the feather-like shapes on the screen. The less space between the shapes, the more easily a user's face could be perceived.
      Initially, I planned to use switch statements for this sketch, but I realized this ultimately wasn't necessary, so instead I decided to use button and slider DOM elements to control the interface.

      <h3>Description</h3>
      
      <p>
      After spending some time with my experimental camera, I realized that the shapes I'd drawn with the camera looked like trees upside down, so I was inspired
      to make tweaks to the code so that the page looked like a forest of trees moving in the wind. I also used a gradient for the background to look like the sky. Given the color palette of the sketch, I found the sketch
      to be quite relaxing, so I created a meditative forest and added calming music. The ultimate goal of the interface is to provide users with a space for relaxation.
      </p>
      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>
      Overall, I'm proud of this sketch. It's simple, but I definitely thought beyond the confines of the p5.js web editor and was able to imagine how
      this sketch could become a website. I'm proud to see my progress in that regard. I'm also proud that I once again managed to push my sketch to GitHub despite some challenges with the terminal that meant I needed to uplaod my files to GitHub manually.
      I would definitely consider returning to this sketch and expanding on it further.

      This interface gives users more control over their privacy. Firstly, it allows users to decide whether or not they want to show or hide their camera. Secondly, it allows users to 
      control the density of the trees, and the higher the density, the easier it is to perceive the user's face within the trees. This feature gives them enhanced control over their privacy. Perhaps if users want to engage with the interface as a means of escape and relaxation, then they do not want to see their own face staring back at them.
      </p>

      <p>
      My interface responds to FRIES in the following ways:
      </p>
      
      <p>
        - Reversible: Users can toggle the show/hide video button, so the decision to display their video feed on the screen is reversible. In addition, the slider value can be changed at anytime, so a user can control how visible their face is within the sketch.
      </p>
      <p>
        - Informed: Users are informed by the text at the bottom of the interface that the sketch is drawn with pixels taken directly from the video feed. This text is succinct, easy to read, and clearly displayed. 
      </p>
    <p>
        - Specific: No data is being acquired from the users other than from their video feed, which users are informed about.
