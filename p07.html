      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>
        My parents separated when I was three years old, and I was raised by my mom.
        I was an only child for many years until my dad eventually remarried and had two children with my step-mom when I
        was twelve years old. Throughout my childhood, I felt alone and isolated while navigating
        the fraught dynamic between my parents and trying to understand where I fit into
        my dad's new cookie-cutter family life. This narrative game explores 
        the experiences many children of divorce face but don't often discuss.
  
      </p>
           
      <h3>Main Character</h3>
      <p>
        The main character of this game is a little girl named Valerie. She's an only child trying to navigate her parents' divorce
        and determine the role she plays in her dad's new life. She ultimately hopes that her parents will
        one day get back together and wishes she had a sibling to weather the storm with her.
        She gets anxious whenever she leaves her mom's house to visit her dad's house, because she doesn't know what her
        role is in his new life.
      </p>

       The descriptions below for each scene in the storyboard go from left to right, starting with the top row.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Title Page: This page displays the name of the game, Where Do I Fit?, and the name of the creator, Ariel Calver. I chose to name the game Where Do I Fit? because, as a child of divorce, I have often found myself in situations with family not knowing my place and being unsure of how I slot into the family dynamic, particularly with my dad and his new family.   
        
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Start Page: This page displays some brief dialogue between the main character and her mom. The main character asks her mom where her dad went before calling out for her dad. Then, the Start Game button appears, and players can commence the game.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Levels Page: This page displays the titles of the three levels in the game.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
       Level 1: Back and Forth
      </p>
      <p>
        I spent most of my childhood travelling back and forth between my parents' houses. It felt like an endless cycle of packing and unpacking, a cycle to which almost every child of divorce can relate. In this first scene of the game, the goal, as the main character, is to pack your suitcase in preparation for heading to your dad's house. As you pack, your thoughts appear on the screen. The level is complete once everything has been packed into the suitcase. I plan to use some kind of drag and drop feature, most likely involving mouse pressed, in order to accomplish this.
      </p>
         
      <p>
       Level 2: Wicked Witch of the West
      </p>
      <p>
       Another challenge many children of divorce often face is meeting their parents' new partners. It is very strange as a young child to one day find a new adult in your life, living in your home and spending time with you and your parent, who you barely know or do not like. I wanted to encapsulate that feeling in this second scene. The goal in this second scene is to stop the Wicked Witch of the West, your dad's new girlfriend, from casting a spell on him and becoming a permant fixture in his life. Your goal is to "collect" all of the swirls on the screen, but this will be impossible. Unfortunately, your efforts will be futile. She will be much bigger than you, and you will be powerless in this situation. As with the previous scene, I plan to display both dialogue on the screen and the main character's internal thoughts. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
       Level 3: Happy Families
      </p>
      
      <p>
      When I was twelve, my dad re-married and had two children with my step-mom. Navigating this situation was incredibly difficult for me, since he did not raise me and wasn't particularly present in my life growing up, and I was now having to watch him play happy families with my stepmom and be a present parent to my half-siblings. I felt very awkward and didn't know my place in their family dynamic. I wanted to encapsulate this feeling in the final scene. The goal in this final scene is to attempt to fit into the family picture. Any time, as the main character, that you try to fit into the photo, you will not be able to get into the frame. Eventually, you will be asked to take the family photo for them instead. Through asking this question, I wanted to highlight how children of divorce, in contexts with new partners or new siblings, often get left out of the picture (in this case, literally) because their parents' new partners do not want them ruining their vision of a happy family. A button will appear for you to take the photo. You will press it. The screen will flash and go black. Then, the game will return to the title page allowing players to restart the game.

        Autobiographical Game: Part 4
      </p>
      <p>
       Creating the game posed more of a challenge than I'd expected. While I had a clear vision for my game when starting the assignment, I now realize that I took too literal of an approach to the assignment. I also stayed within my comfort zone in terms of the visuals for the game. Seeing my classmates' games made me realize that I need to continue to push myself outside my comfort zone of 2D illustration. In terms of building out the code for the game, I also ran into several challenges: getting the music to play in Visual Studio Code, restarting the game, dragging and dropping objects.
        All of these aspects took way more time than expected, but I learned a lot through the process of debugging. For instance, I learned that the reason that the interactive objects were not dragging and dropping independently of one another is because each object had a larger, transparent background around it that I could not see, so I was unknowingly grabbing the transparent backgrounds of multiple objects at once. In order to rectify this issue, I needed to crop the backgrounds of the images used for the interactive objects before loading them into Visual Studio Code. In addition, I realised, after several days' worth of trial and error, that the reason my music sounded choppy was because the if else logic I'd created was saying if the song isn't playing, play it, and if the song is playing already, stop it. Instead, I simply needed a basic if statement that said, if the song isn't playing, play it. 
        Overall, I'm proud of how much I learned through building this game: switch statements, classes, how to use Visual Studio Code, how to load files into a GitHub repository and host a game, and more. My main takeaways are 1) that I do not need to interpret an assingment so literally 2) I need to continue exploring different media and ways for visualizing my ideas
