      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
       This experimental camera creates a feather-like texture using rgb values from a live-video feed. I particularly love how the strands of the feather move, as if they are blowing in the wind.
       I was initially interested in using shaders this week. While I loved learning about shaders through
       tutorials provided on the course website, I realized that creating my own shaders within the time constraints
       was not going to be feasible. Instead, I decided I wanted to create some kind of texture using the video input
       from my computer, specifically the rgb values of the pixels in the video. The camera is meant to capture people and creates particularly beautiful patterns if a user is wearing different
       colors. I can foresee pictures from this camera being used as the background of a website. This camera reflects the beauty in every day things while providing users with a sense of anonymity when using the camera, since it is not clear that a human face is what is being captured.

        These were my three initial ideas. I knew I wanted to create some kind of texture using rgb values from the video feed.
        I'd made a woven, sweater-like texture for a p5 sketch a while back, so I ultimately decided to pursue idea #1, since I could draw on elements from that sketch in this one.

      Through this process, I discovered an interest in shaders. Given my background in mathematics, I'm keen to explore this area further.
      In addition, I learned how to play with perspective. Without telling someone that some of these images are of faces, they may never realize that the beautiful patterns produced by the camera are of people.
