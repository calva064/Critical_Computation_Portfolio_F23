      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>
        I chose to draw my stuffed animal from childhood, Boo Boo. I wanted to 
        explore the notion of loss in terms of how pieces of an object - 
        in this case, fur, shape, and color - can be lost over time and how 
        loss can be a direct result of love.

      <h3>Design Process and Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        Provided by my partner, Sarah Celidonio:
        
        "When I was young, I had a necklace that I loved. 
        It was one of those clear teardrop-shaped pendants with a bug encased inside. 
        This necklace had a green, iridescent scarab beetle set in the middle and was
        about 2.5 inches tall by 2 inches wide with a 1 inch beetle inside, 
        hanging from a black lanyard."
         </p>
      <p>
        
        The language Sarah used to describe the object, a pendant with a bug encased 
        inside on a lanyard, was specific but relied on the assumption that I had already
        seen the object, or an object like it, before. She referred to the necklace as 
        “one of those…” which suggested she believed I was familiar with those necklaces, 
        which I luckily was, so I already had a mental reference point for how I might draw
        the necklace. Sarah provided specific dimensions for the object in inches and described 
        the color of the object. The only detail she didn’t provide was about the object’s material. 
        I assumed that the pendant was made of glass, plastic, or some kind of jewel, 
        since she described the pendant as clear, but this was left open to interpretation to
        some degree as was determining what material the lanyard was made from.
         </p>
      <p>
        
        Initially, I planned to draw the necklace that Sarah had described to me. 
        Here is an initial sketch I drew by hand and some of my notes:
         </p>

        />
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.global/243f2e74-eb0b-41b9-8c26-f5d42f14d9ff/Screenshot%202023-09-14%20at%208.57.44%20PM.png?v=1694741510819"
        />
        
      <p>
        I realized, though, after drawing my sketch that the sketch was too detailed for it to easily be translated into code; 
        I need to boil the object down to its basic shapes, elements, and lines. Here is a screenshot of my initial experimentations 
        with this sketch:
         </p>
        
        <iframe
        allow="camera"
          height="450"
          src="https://editor.p5js.org/calva064/full/0FlGce4XN"
        
        ></iframe>
        
      <p>
        
        I found myself becoming frustrated throughout the process of creating this sketch, 
        because I ultimately wasn’t inspired by the prompt. I wanted to do something that had
        meaning to me, so I began thinking more about the notion of loss or a lost object. 
        I thought about a stuffed animal that I had when I was a little kid: a black and
        white panda, named Bamboo (Boo Boo for short.) I carried Boo Boo around with me everywhere,
        dragging him along the ground by his paw. His white fur turned grey, shape distorted, 
        and mouth began to fray. Exposed patches of mesh even developed on his face and body 
        from where his fur had rubbed away.
      </p>
      <p>
      
        I chose Boo Boo as my object, since I was inspired to think about loss within the context of 
        losing parts of an object – color, shape, and fur - rather than a whole object itself. 
        I also wanted to reframe loss and explore how loss can be a direct result of love. Boo Boo 
        is definitely well-loved.
      </p>
      <p>
 
        I began by drawing Boo Boo to get a feel for what shapes I wanted to use in P5. Then, 
        implementing the lesson I learned from drawing the pendant and trying to translate that to code, 
        I ensured to boil my sketch down to basic shapes like 2D primitives that I knew I would be able 
        to re-create in P5:
     </p>
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.global/243f2e74-eb0b-41b9-8c26-f5d42f14d9ff/Screenshot%202023-09-14%20at%209.45.19%20PM.png?v=1694742332341"
        />
        
      <p>
        Given that I have some prior experience with P5, I chose to incorporate some of that experience 
        into my sketch while also remembering that the focus of the assignment was to use 2D primitives 
        and functions like translate, rotate, push, pop, fill, and blend Mode. For the most part, 
        I used several ellipses to create the desired shape!
      </p>
      <p>
        At first, I just drew Boo Boo, but then I began thinking about my memories tied to Boo Boo and how
        he was always a source of comfort, particularly at night when I had nightmares. I then began thinking 
        about what our favorite stuffed animals do at night while we’re asleep. I pictured Boo Boo staring at 
        the moon and gazing at the stars, so I thought it would be sweet to draw an image of him staring at the
        moon. I took advantage of the random function to create blades of grass. I also used the curveVertex function,
        a function I’d never used before, for making some of the more awkward shapes. Finally, to create the stars, 
        I used a loop. The stars are scattered evenly in the sky, which was a design decision; I know, realistically, 
        that stars are neither evenly spaced apart nor low in the sky, but I liked the way my design looked, so I 
        kept it that way, even if it doesn’t make logical sense.
