This site showcases my work from Critical Computation Lab, fall 2023, taught by Katherine Moriwaki and Elizabeth Perez. This comprises a portfolio that documents my projects, small and large, from 2D primitives to object-oriented programming in a game.

Each project and its documentation can also be accessed on my Glitch page here: https://ariel-calver-cclab-portfolio.glitch.me/
