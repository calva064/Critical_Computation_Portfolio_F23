      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>
        My primary goal this week was to push myself outside of my comfort zone. Taking on board Regina's feedback
        from last week that the sketches I was producing were cartoonish and lacked variety, I wanted to try making something
        different from my previous three sketches. I ensured to incorporate the required technical components into
        my sketch, user-defined functions; arguments; and parameters, but beyond this I gave myself creative freedom
        to explore and experiment. Please note that you may have to play the sketch directly
        from my p5.js page rather than my Glitch portfolio, as I can't seem to hear the sound when I play the sketch from Glitch.

       For part one of the assignment, I designed this non-human figure:

        Here is her backstory: This is Mrs. Spoon. She’s been around since the early 19th century, 
        and she’s tired of people’s bullshit! While she’s over 200 years old, she never fails to look glamorous.

      <h1>Design Process and Reflection</h1>


      <p>
        Ultimately, I decided not to draw a human or non-human figure using the sketches me and my partners, Arden and Prashant, had drawn. I truly
        wanted to give myself creative liberty to make something different this week and feel comfortable with creating
        from a place of wanting to make something cool rather than restricting myself to the confines of an assignemnt. 
        Since I'm passionate about music, I decided I wanted to design either an album cover or a website for a musician.
        I looked at some musicians' websites for inspiration, and I also looked at album covers. Noticing that many musicians
        feature photos on the covers of their albums, I was inspired to use images for my sketch. I also 
        wanted to incorporate text into my sketch, since I haven't used text for the past three assignments.
        
         </p>
      <p>
        Since I sought to experiment with this sketch, I struggled to create an initial hand-drawn sketch
        of what I planned to execute in p5.js; I knew I would be spending most of my time experimenting and playing around in p5.js
        in order to get a sense for how I could develop my aesthetic. I did some basic mind-mapping, and here is an image of notes from my brainstorming session:

         </p>
      
      <img
           src="https://cdn.glitch.global/243f2e74-eb0b-41b9-8c26-f5d42f14d9ff/Screenshot%202023-10-06%20at%207.34.21%20AM.png?v=1696592073210"
           />
      
      <p>
        As the image above shows, some initial ideas I had were to: outline a woman's body using squiggles, pull music into p5.js, fade in/out elements, and incorporate music into my design that syncs up with animation.
        I ultimately decided that I wanted to design some kind of 
        kind of visual for a musician's website incorporating these ideas.
    
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I began by loading album artwork from a musician I like, Rhye, into p5.js and experimenting with how the image was rendered.
        I added a tint to the image and then began thinking about how I could incorporate text into my design. Since my sketch revolves around music,
        I wanted to incorporate his song lyrics into my design. I thought that using song lyrics to outline or draw the woman in the image,
        in order to create my human form, could be visually exciting.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In order to know where to place the lyrics along the woman's body, I found a tutorial online that demonstrated how to trace an
        image in p5.js by printing the mouse's X and Y coordinates to the console: console.log(mouseX,mouseY). I used this to get precise 
        coordinates for my lyrics so that I was able to place them precisely along the curvature of her body.     
      </p>
      
      <p>
        While making this sketch, I learned how to load font into p5.js, create a tint on an image, and create a gradient with color. I also reviewed
        several Coding Train videos to remind myself of how Noise works, as I wanted to use Noise in my sketch. While I considered incorporating
        gradients and Noise into my sketch, I ultimately didn't like how my sketch looked when I did this. Here are some screenshots of my 
        work in progress incorporating gradients:
      </p>

        />
        
<p>
        Taking inspiration from a collage I saw recently, I realized that my sketch would look better if I blacked out the background and part of the woman's arm so that the sketch
        looked more like a collage than an image!
  
      </p>
      
      <p>
       After implementing this change, I turned my attention back to the text. I was interested in making the text's color and size a function of time. I wanted
        to load Rhye's music into p5.js and have the text fade/appear and get bigger/smaller depending on where in the song the music was playing. 
        I ran into some hurdles while trying to do this. For one, I could not determine how to load the entire sound file into p5.js. p5.js said the file size 
        was too big, so I ended up recording the audio on my phone and then loading that file into p5.js. Next, I took advantage of the millis() function
        in order to control when the lyrics appeared on the screen so that they timed up with the music.
        
      </p>

        Overall, this week was a huge challenge for me. I threw myself into the deep-end, not letting myself rely on what I know and am comfortable with:
        creating cartoonish characters out of 2D primitives. As a result, the end product of my experimentations is not as well-developed as I had envisioned,
        and I would love to continue working on this sketch so that I can get the fade in/fade out part of my code to function better, since I think this would look great. Since I made
        a lot of adjustments to my code, this affected the fade in/fade out lines I wrote in my code. I do like
        how my sketch looks aesthetically, though.
